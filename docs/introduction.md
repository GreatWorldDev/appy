## What is appy?
appy is an open source fully featured full-stack web app + user system. It's purpose is two fold:

1) Provide a bootstrapping platform to quickly implement and test out [mvp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) ideas.
2) Provide working examples of modern web-app features for those interested in learning how technologies can integrate.

While there are other open source full-stack web apps out there, we couldn't find any that sufficiently meet these goals. appy is built with technologies that allow you to quickly adapt it to your specific needs. Our goal is to provide a working platform with easy to follow documentaion covering all of the major features so you can bootstrap your own awesome app! ðŸ˜‰

While we feel appy is already a useful tool, there is awlays room for improvement. We aim to continue to improve appy and add more useful features as we go, and we would love for you to pitch in!
